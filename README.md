# ðŸ”’ Tab Blocker

Tab Blocker is a browser extension that automatically closes new tabs opened in blacklisted/frozen domains, helping you avoid intrusive popups, redirect spam, and unwanted tab behavior.

This project is to copy the functionality of the original Tab Freezer that was removed from the Chrome Web Store as it wasn't updated to make it compatible with policy changes

## ðŸš€ Features
    
- âœ… Freeze any domain with a single click from the extension icon
- âœ… Automatically close tabs opened by frozen domains
- âœ… Context menu override: Right-click a link on a frozen domain to open it anyway
- âœ… Options page to view and manage chosen domains (individually or all at once)
- âœ… Badge counter to track how many tabs were blocked

## ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Development
This project was built with support from Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, AI companions that provided development guidance, refactored code, helped adapt the extension for Manifest V3, and crafted documentation and images.

Special thanks for making the process smoother, smarter, and occasionally more entertaining.
