# 🔒 Tab Blocker (Chrome-Compatible Rebuild)

Tab Blocker is a browser extension that automatically closes new tabs opened in blacklisted domains — helping you avoid intrusive popups, redirect spam, and unwanted tab behavior.

This project is to copy the functionality of the original [Tab Freezer](https://github.com/lynk/webext-tabfreezer), which is no longer allowed on the Chrome Web Store due to policy changes and limitations with tab management APIs.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Block domains from auto-opening new tabs
- ✅ Auto-close popups or child tabs from chosen domains
- ✅ Icon toggle to freeze/unfreeze the current domain
- ✅ Badge counter to track how many tabs were blocked
- ✅ Options page to view and manage chosen domains (individually or all at once)
- ✅ Manifest V3-compatible for current and future Chrome builds

🤖 AI-Assisted Development
This project was built with support from Microsoft Copilot, an AI companion that provided development guidance, refactored code, helped adapt the extension for Manifest V3, and crafted documentation and images.

Special thanks for making the process smoother, smarter, and occasionally more entertaining.
